# UPP465-project2

Welcome to my first GeoJson map! This is the final project for UIC's Summer Class UPP465 In this repository I am showcasing a heat map for Salvadorian remittances for the 2020 Fiscal Year. The Remittance data comes from the Salvadorian Central Bank (https://bcr.gob.sv) and the map was merged in QGIS using the shapefiles from https://data.humdata.org/dataset/el-salvador-administrative-level-0-1-and-2-boundaries
